# CODSOFTtask1 : To build a model in titanic data set.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. 
# OBJECTIVE:
To build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using the titanic data set.
# LIBRARIES USED:
 
 1. numpy is used for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

 2. pandas is used data structures like DataFrame and Series, which allow for easy manipulation, analysis, and cleaning of structured data.

 3. sklearn is useful for data mining and data analysis, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction

 4. matplotlib is useful for a wide range of plotting capabilities, from basic line plots to complex 3D plots

 5. seaborn is useful for high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics

# STEPS INVOLVED:

 1. Data collection.

 2. Data cleaning

 3. Data Visualization.

 4. Model Training
